/**
 A type of easing function, described from an algorithmic classification and acceleration
 pattern, providing the sense of motion.

 > "Nothing in nature moves linearly from one point to another. In reality, things tend to
 > accelerate or decelerate as they move. Our brains are wired to expect this kind of
 > motion, so when animating you should use this to your advantage. Natural motion
 > makes your users feel more comfortable with your apps, which in turn leads to a better
 > overall experience."
